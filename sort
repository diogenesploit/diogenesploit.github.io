Sorting a DNS transfer file:
sort -t . -k 6,6n dns_axfr_results.txt
# The field 6,6n applies to how far the IP address is into each line.
Example:
example.site.local has address 11.12.1.8
example2.site.local has address 11.12.1.5
example3.site.local has address 11.12.1.20
example4.site.local has address 11.12.1.2

$ sort -t . -k 6,6n dns_axfr_results.txt

example4.site.local has address 11.12.1.2
example2.site.local has address 11.12.1.5
example.site.local has address 11.12.1.8
example3.site.local has address 11.12.1.20

-t . : Set field to "." which is what our IPs contain.
-k 6,6n : In our example text file, the IP addresses start in the sixth field of the row.
-n : Tells *sort* to use numeric order. 
nr : If you wanted reverse numeric order, with the highest IP first.
